We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: 

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower. 

However, when you guess a particular number x,  and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.


Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.



Given a particular n &ge; 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
